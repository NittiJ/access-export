I wanted to follow up since I haven’t yet received a response on this. I’m currently auditing some of the providers listed in the BDC reporting we receive. While I do have access to the BlueWeb BDC data, I’m trying to better understand how the final report is structured, specifically what filter or logic is used in Quest Analytics Suite to identify providers by designation.

Would you be able to clarify what criteria or filters are applied in Quest when these designations are determined? I’m just hoping to align our internal review with how the association’s output is being generated.

Really appreciate your help on this!
