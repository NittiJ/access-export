I wanted to clarify an important point regarding the addresses we use in our provider disruption reports. While billing addresses are sometimes readily available, they are not suitable for this type of reporting. Billing addresses frequently list PO boxes or administrative office locations, which do not correspond to the physical sites where care is actually delivered.

Relying on billing information can distort the results of a disruption analysis because:

PO boxes do not reflect a geographic location of care

Administrative addresses may be in a different ZIP code or even a different state from where services are provided

Using billing addresses can misrepresent member access and continuity of care

For these reasons, disruption reporting should rely on the provider’s service location address, which accurately identifies the site of care delivery. This ensures our reporting reflects the true network impact on members, both geographically and from an access-to-care standpoint.

Please let me know if you’d like me to provide any supporting references or examples to further illustrate this. I’m happy to discuss this in more detail if helpful.
