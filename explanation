Billing addresses generally refer to where a provider or practice receives payments, and they often point to a PO box or a central administrative office. These addresses can be in an entirely different ZIP code, city, or even state from where care is actually delivered.

Rendering (or service location) addresses, on the other hand, identify the physical site where patients receive care. This is critical for disruption reporting, because it directly relates to member access to providers and continuity of care.
